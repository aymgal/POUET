Adapt POUET to another observing site
*************************************

This feature, along with its tutorial, will be fully available in a future version of POUET (target is either v0.4 or the official release).

In the meantime, you can still change the default observing Site configuration, but beware that the allsky view will not be adapted anymore. You can deactivate it from the ``Configuration`` tab (see :ref:`alttabs`).
