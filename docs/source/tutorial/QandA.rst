Why this name?
==============

Because it sounds funny


Can I use it from everywhere?
=============================

Technically, yes. You just need to define a new config file associated to your location, and disable the webcam (Tutorial TBW).


How much trust can I put in your weather report?
================================================

The weather variable displayed in the code are directly copied from `La Silla weather report <http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/dimm/meteo.last>`_. However, we offer no guarantee that the displayed information are always up to date. Always refer to the official weather report of your observatory - POUET is NOT a replacement for it.


It's full of bugs! What should I do?
====================================

Head over to our `github repository <https://github.com/vbonvin/POUET>`_ and explain to us what is happening. We will do our best to answer within reasonable delays.


How can I contribute?
=====================

The code is in open access (GNU GPLv3), feel free to reach us on `github <https://github.com/vbonvin/POUET>`_ and propose your help.


The code seems...a bit convoluted sometimes, to say the least.
==============================================================

Both authors have learned (py)Qt coding this project. Be understanding.


I've heard about a carnival mode...?
====================================

Shhh...it's a secret! Pay attention to the details, though, you might find it yourself...
