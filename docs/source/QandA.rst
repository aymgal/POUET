Questions & Answers

Why this name?
**************

Because it sounds funny.


Can I use POUET from every observatory?
***************************************

Technically, yes. You just need to define a new config file associated to your location, and disable the webcam (see :ref:`customsite`).


How much trust can I put in your weather report?
************************************************

The weather variable displayed in the code are directly copied from `La Silla weather report <http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/dimm/meteo.last>`_. Staled weather information turns the ``Site`` tab red in POUET. However, we offer no guarantee that the displayed information is correct. Always refer to the official weather report of your observatory - POUET is not a replacement for it.


It's full of bugs! What should I do?
************************************

Head over to our `github repository <https://github.com/vbonvin/POUET>`_ and explain to us what is happening. We will do our best to answer within reasonable delays.


How can I contribute?
*********************

The code is in open access (GNU GPLv3), feel free to reach us on `github <https://github.com/vbonvin/POUET>`_ and propose your help.


The code seems...a bit convoluted sometimes, to say the least.
**************************************************************

Both authors have learned (py)Qt coding this project. Be understanding.


What is POUET's future?
***********************

We aim to make it as modulable as possible, so it can be used from anywhere.
