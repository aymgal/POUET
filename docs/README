How to compile the doc with that half shit-half genius software that is Spinx

1) Do NOT run the sphinx-apidoc command anymore. That will break the current structure.

2) make clean

3) make html - a few warning are still popping up...


If you want to add a new module, do it BY HAND in source/foo.rst

#todo: fix that sphinx-apidoc issue
