=================================

POUET - Programing Observations Usefully at the Euler Telescope

This software helps you planning your observation nights at ANY telescope in the ESO-La Silla Observatory. But POULSO was a crappy software name, and both authors liked the Swiss Leonhard Euler Telescope a lot.

Why using this software and not one of the dozens of alternatives already existing out there? The strongest case is certainly that POUET provides a real-time analysis of the weather situation, including automatic clouds detection from the `Danish telescope AllSky Camera <http://allsky-dk154.asu.cas.cz>`_.

Designed by observers for observers. With lots of love and hopefully bug-free.
